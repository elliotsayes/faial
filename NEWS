- Better support for analyzing templated kernels with type-parameters.
- Added support for analyzing memory accesses in a return statement.
- Added initial support for scoped atomic operations (no support for
  threadfence yet).
- Added support for grid-level analysis (with approximation analysis support).
- Reworked the UI of approximation analysis.
- Improved the approximation analysis to be more precise per report.
- Added support for static_assert.
- Added support for only checking DRF for two specific threadIdx.
- Added support for only checking DRF for a single array.
- Added support for only checking DRF for a single index location (equality,
  less-equal-than, greater-equal-than).
- Made kernel calls optional (enabled by default).
- Added support for calling kernels with overloaded types.
- Improved the array aliasing analysis.
- Added support for calling other kernels with __device__ modifiers.
- Added support for array aliasing via the & operator.

2024-01:
