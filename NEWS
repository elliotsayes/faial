2024-03:
- Inference: improved how we handle mutated variables in loops/conditionals.
- Inference: added support for preserving the types from declarations.
- Inference: now recognizes typedef.
- Inference: fixed a regression where certain functions weren't being
  recognized (introduced with kernel calls)
- Inference: added support for enumeration.
- Inference: improved support for kernel calls.
- Inference: improved support for array aliasing.
- Inference: added support for bitwise not (~).
- DRF: analysis is more precise by using typing information.
- DRF: only check a given blockIdx

2024-02:
- DRF: initial support for scoped atomic operations (no support for
  threadfence yet).
- DRF: grid-level analysis (with approximation analysis support).
- DRF: reworked the UI of approximation analysis.
- DRF: improved the approximation analysis to be more precise per report.
- DRF: only check a given threadIdx.
- DRF: only check a single array.
- DRF: only check a single index location (equality, less-equal-than,
  greater-equal-than).
- DRF: made kernel calls optional (enabled by default).
- Inference: added support for analyzing templated kernels with type-parameters.
- Inference: added support for analyzing memory accesses in a return statement.
- Inference: added support for static_assert.
- Inference: added support for calling kernels with overloaded types.
- Inference: improved the array aliasing analysis.
- Inference: added support for calling other kernels with __device__ modifiers.
- Inference: added support for array aliasing via the & operator.

2024-01:
- BarrierDiv: added support for checking barrier divergence (faial-sync).
- DRF: now gives return status of 2 when there is a parsing error.
- DRF: allowed passing include directories to the C parser with -I.
- Inference: basic support for function `sync` of cooperative_groups
  (ignores scopes).
