# We declare exactly one shared location, named x
shared x;

# We declare a thread-global constant
const global SIZE;

# Keywords `shared` and `const` consist of the preamble and must appear
# before the model, which in this example is a single memory access.

# All threads are writing (and possibly also reading) to position
# the same position of the array, position SIZE.

rw x[SIZE];
